Create a simple iOS app that plays random .mp3 files from the location of your choice. The app should:

* Include a stop and start function

* Display the elapsed time

* Display basic metadata of the audio file

* Have the ability to run in the background, allowing for other sounds to be output while continuing to play the .mp3

* Be created without the use of third-party libraries

Once you have completed your assignment, please submit your code to a private git repository or as an e-mail attachment (you might have to rename common archive extensions).
